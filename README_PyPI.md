# Welcome to GlassPy
GlassPy is a Python module for scientists working with glass materials.

## What is it?
The aim is to provide classes and functions written in Python for the materials scientists working with glass. The hope is that with an open and collaborative project, we can build a reliable toolset to support faster and reproducible research on glass materials.

## Development
GlassPy was born as a personal tool back in 2013 when I started coding with Python. It is based on a colection of MATLAB code that I wrote for the Glass State graduate course of 2010 and for the numerical analysis for my PhD.
Right now, I'm sorting all my code and adequately documenting it to build this Python module. My personal objective is to increase the reproducibility of my research and hopefully glass science in general.
The motivation for

## Roadmap
This repository is in its infancy. The current version is 0.1.dev1, which means that it is not intended for public use right now.
My objective for version 0.1 is to have working classes for the regression of nucleation density data.

## Documentation
There is no documentation right now, but all the functions have a detailed docstring.
Examples in the form of Jupyter Notebooks can be found [here](https://github.com/drcassar/glasspy/tree/master/doc/examples).
